The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills gained in the Data Science course through the presentation of two distinct projects. The first Data Science project involves the utilisation of public data from a financial market data provider to conduct statistical analysis and evaluate relationships and potential impacts of some of the largest financial indices on the S&P500 Index. The second project concentrates on utilising data tools, visualizations, and dashboards to create the visualisation around listed company earnings, allowing Fund Managers and Equity Traders to draw meaningful conclusions effortlessly.
